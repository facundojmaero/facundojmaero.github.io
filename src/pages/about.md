Hey there, Facundo here! I’m a computer engineer from Córdoba,
Argentina. I spend my days mainly working with Python, JavaScript,
TypeScript and Docker building backend and frontend systems.

My favorite hobbies are coding, reading, and learning new things. I
also love music from a wide variety of genres, but I mainly spend
time listening to prog and alternative rock.

Other things I enjoy are watching Formula 1, playing tennis and
padel, and occasionally gaming solo or with my friends. There may be
some easter eggs related to these topics around the blog. You have
been warned ;)
